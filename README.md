# Email-Domain-Fetcher

The script takes in a CSV file, a domain name, and an output filepath. The CSV should have a column with emails in it and the column name should contain the word "email" (case insensitive) somewhere in it. The script will find the email column, then find all of the emails that have the specified domain name, give the user a count of how many there are, and output the results to the specified filepath. There is an inverse option, where it will do the same thing but with the emails that don't contain the specified domain.

Note: This was for a class project and I just copied it in here, hence, there are no prior commits.
